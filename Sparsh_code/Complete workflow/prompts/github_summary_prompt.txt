**SEARCH CONTEXT:**

**Your Task:**
Extract, analyze, and summarize the developer's GitHub presence into a structured JSON object. Focus on tangible evidence of skill, project complexity, and influence.

- Identify the most prominent programming languages.
- List 1-3 of their most notable or complex repositories mentioned in the context.
- From the repository summaries, assess the technical complexity and purpose of their main projects.
- Provide a concise summary of their primary technical focus or domain (e.g., "Web Development with React," "Data Engineering," "Cloud Infrastructure").
- If no information is found for a field, use an empty list or "N/A".

Your response must be a single JSON object with this exact schema:
{
  "key_languages": ["<List of languages, e.g., 'Python', 'TypeScript'>"],
  "notable_repositories": ["<List of repo names, e.g., 'unicorn-radar-backend'>"],
  "project_complexity_assessment": "<Analyze the complexity and purpose of their key projects based on the README summaries. Is this a simple portfolio or complex software?>",
  "technical_focus": "<A concise summary of their likely expertise, e.g., 'Frontend Development with a focus on data visualization.'>"
}
